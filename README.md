Just a simulation of a Pokemon journey through the console.

Start with a random pokemon, at a random (low) level with proper IV spread and nature (even with 1/4092 shiny odds).

Has proper leveling system, item abilities, EVs, ability to buy and use items. Encounter random pokemon that are also randomly generated with proper IVs, nature, and a chance to be shiny through the battle option.
Buy items through the Shop option. Use items through the Inventory. Check your own pokemon through Switch Pokemon and Pokemon stats.
Lastly quit with I am a nerd and I quit.

Battling is very simple, you can only attack using your own typings (no moves, 100% accuracy, however you can use X-items, mega evolutions, and other items).


Here is a short example of starting a game, battling a random pokemon, buying something, displaying the pokemon stats, and quitting:
